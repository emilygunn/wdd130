        <p>My name is Emily Gunn and I am currently majoring in Software Engineering. </p>
        <p>I have four sisters, three of which are older and one younger. All of my older sisters have attended or are attending BYU-I so I am excited to follow in their footsteps.</p>
        <p>I chose to take this class becasue I love computers and I want to be able to code many different things. I think being able to understand and code my own websites will be very useful no matter what I end up doing for my career.</p>
